Alex, I am happy I could expose you to another way of looking at pi with
tau. It has been a while since I looked at it, and seems it was the
definition of tau that was the main thing for me. It may be a bad term for
cross-over into electricity, or maybe I am missing something. I really do
not recall how they defined tau offhand, as that was last semester. Seems
it was an interesting read, but I recall it did not help with what I was
looking for.

I found the anti-pi movement while looking for a better explanation of
Inductive tau (tau = L/R) versus Capacitive tau (tau = R*C). While the
anti-pi was interesting, my memory is that it went against the time
constant application, but maybe I need to look closer.

In any event, I will try to look at it again prior to Wednesday class. I
look forward to hearing your thoughts. --Joe
