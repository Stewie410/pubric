Hello Mrs. Hughes,

I had a quick question about the upcoming graduation ceremony about
attendance--at the end of the questionare, I was posed with a "Do you plan
to attend?" question, to which I responded with a "I don't know".  Frankly,
if I can avoid the anxiety of walking across a stage in front of a huge
crowd of people; but still be able to graduate, I would by all means prefer
that method.  So, assuming all goes well and I will be graduating in May,
am I required to attend the official graduation ceremony?

Thanks,
Richard
