Hello Mr. Wilson,

I just had a couple of questions about the discount that your program for
the CompTIA Certifications, considering now that I'm done with my program I
can focus on getting said certifications. However I noticed that the cost
of the vouchers from the website is a bit high and I had heard about the
discount program at Cape fear. So I was wondering either what all I needed
To do to either apply or to qualify for the discount program. If my
completion of my program means that I am no longer qualified, then let me
know.

For reference the program I have completed what's the computer engineering
technologies associates degree. I was one of the last ones left there I'm
not even sure if there's anyone still in the program or if I was the last
one out.  Also, the three certification vouchers I would be interested in
would be for A+, Security and Networking.

My apologies for the two very strange voicemails and the lack of email it's
been a very interesting couple of days. In fact, at the time of writing my
right hand is wrapped up in an ace bandage because I seem to be having some
slight pseudo-carpal tunnel symptoms.

Thank you for your time,
Alex Paarfus
